The first view contains a search field, the search button, and the playlist button. 

After entering search criteria, the user clicks the search button. This results in a table view containing the top 10 results from Youtube. At this point, the user can select a video by its title or go back. By selecting a title, the play view appears allowing the user to view the selected video. Additionally there is an Add to Playlist button that adds the current video to the local playlist for later access. 

Instead of clicking search on the first view, the user can also click Playlist leading to the videos that have been saved locally. Like the search results, the user can select a video by title and watch it. In the playlist's table view, there is an edit button which allows the user to change the playlist. Once edit is clicked, selecting a video causes it to be removed from the playlist.
